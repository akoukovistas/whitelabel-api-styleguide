Please note:

This is something that can vary greatly between products, this page is only meant to provide some guidance and common rules of engagement based on previous experience and best practices.

## Important points to consider when deprecating an API

*   How can we announce the deprecation to our customers? Timings, channels of communication, timeframe an API can exist as "to be deprecated", etc
*   How can we utilize our infrastructure to introduce a new version?
*   How can we use some of our products to help our customers transition to the new API version?
*   When do we mark an API as ready to be deprecated and obsolete?
